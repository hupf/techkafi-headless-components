# Headless Component

The design pattern‚Ñ¢

Separation of rendering & UI \
from behavior & state management

Headless Component = Component Primitive

Bring your own styles

---
layout: quote
transition: slide-up
level: 2
---

¬´In essence, a Headless Component is a function or object that encapsulates logic, but doesn‚Äôt render anything itself. It leaves the rendering part to the consumer, thus offering a high degree of flexibility in how the UI is rendered.¬ª

# Headless Component

How to extract that logic & state?

React:
- hooks
- render props
- low-level components
- context
- HOCs

Angular:
- directives
- services
- (ng-templates)

# React Dropdown

```ts
// The "headless component" or component primitive
function useDropdown() {
  // ...all the dropdown logic/state
  return {
    // ...exposed logic/state
  };
}

// Our component implementation using the "headless component"
function Dropdown({ items }: DropdownProps) {
  const {
    isOpen,
    selectedItem,
    selectedIndex,
    toggleDropdown,
    handleKeyDown,
    setSelectedItem,
  } = useDropdown(items);

  return (
    // ...render & style the UI using the available logic/state
  );
}
```

# Why Headless Components?

- Reusability & DRY
- Maintainability & testing
- Versatility & customizability

Put (UI) power in the developer's hands

# Approaches

Should I use existing components or craft them by hand?

# Approaches: Pre-Built Components

Component Libraries

- Ready-made components ‚Äì install and go üöÄ
- "Customization" via configuration, theming & component attributes/props
  - Little control
  - Hard to implement customer's CI/CD
  - Every site/app looks the same... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
- Huge/complex dependency, may even block framework upgrade

# Approaches: Pre-Built Components (cont.)

Component Libraries

Examples:
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/), [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
- [Adobe Spectrum](https://spectrum.adobe.com/) (React, WC)
- [Radix Themes](https://www.radix-ui.com/) (React)
- ...

# Approaches: DIY Components

No Component Library

- Craft your own components/design system from the ground up
  - Full control
  - Complex & laborious üò´
- A11y/ARIA, keyboard control, responsiveness, async data loading, feature set ‚Üí ü§Ø
  - Even hard for simple dropdown, what about a datepicker?
- No dependency
- Examples: \
  [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), Vanilla CSS

# Approaches: Headless Components

Primitive Library

- Build your own components using existing primitives
- Customization via custom rendering & styling
  - Full control over UI/look
  - Easily implement customer's CI/CD & UX requirements
- Simple dependency (only install required primitives)
