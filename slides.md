# Headless Components

The design pattern‚Ñ¢

Separation of rendering & UI \
from behavior & state

Headless Component = Component Primitive

---
layout: quote
transition: slide-up
level: 2
---

¬´In essence, a Headless Component is a function or object that encapsulates logic, but doesn‚Äôt render anything itself. It leaves the rendering part to the consumer, thus offering a high degree of flexibility in how the UI is rendered.¬ª

# Headless Components

How to extract that logic & state?

React:
- hooks
- render props
- low-level components
- context
- HOCs

Angular:
- directives
- services
- (ng-templates)

# React Dropdown

```ts
// The "headless component" or component primitive
function useDropdown() {
  // ...all the dropdown logic/state
  return {
    // ...exposed logic/state
  };
}

// Our component implementation using the "headless component"
function Dropdown({ items }: DropdownProps) {
  const {
    isOpen,
    selectedItem,
    selectedIndex,
    toggleDropdown,
    handleKeyDown,
    setSelectedItem,
  } = useDropdown(items);

  return (
    // ...render & style the UI using the available logic/state
  );
}
```

# Why Headless Components?

- Reusability & DRY
- Maintainability & testing
- Versatility & customizability

<div class="text-center mt-10">
‚Üí Inversion of control:
Put (UI) power in the developer's hands

# Approaches

Should I use existing components or craft them by hand?

# Approaches: Pre-Built Components

Component Libraries

- Ready-made components ‚Äì install and go üöÄ
- "Customization" via configuration, theming & component attributes/props
  - Little control
  - Hard to implement customer's CI/CD
  - Every site/app looks the same... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
- Huge/complex dependency
  - Hard to upgrade (markup/style changes)
  - May even block framework upgrade

# Approaches: Pre-Built Components (cont.)

Component Libraries

Examples:
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/), [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
- [Adobe Spectrum](https://spectrum.adobe.com/) (React, WC)
- [Radix Themes](https://www.radix-ui.com/) (React)
- ...

# Approaches: DIY Components

No Library

- Craft your own components/design system from the ground up
  - Full control
  - Complex & laborious üò´
- A11y/ARIA, keyboard control, responsiveness, async data loading, feature set ‚Üí ü§Ø
  - Even hard for simple dropdown, what about a datepicker?
- No dependency
- Examples: \
  [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), Vanilla CSS

# Approaches: Headless Components

Primitive Library

- Build your own components using existing primitives
- Customization via custom rendering & styling
  - Full control over UI/look
  - Bring your own styles‚Ñ¢
  - Easily implement customer's CI/CD & UX requirements
- Simple dependency (only install required primitives)

# Approaches: Headless Components (cont.)

Primitive Library

Examples:

- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) (React, Vue) ‚Üí from the makers of Tailwind
- [React ARIA](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) (React) ‚Üí Adobe Spectrum builds on this
- [Radix Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) (React) ‚Üí Radix Themes builds on this
- [Kobalte](https://kobalte.dev/) (SolidJS)
- [Melt UI](https://www.melt-ui.com/) (Svelte)
- [Angular CDK](https://material.angular.io/cdk/) ‚Üí Angular Material builds on this
- [Angular Primitives](https://angularprimitives.com/)
- [Ark UI](https://ark-ui.com/) (React, Solid, Vue, Svelte)

# shadcn/ui

What the heck is this thing?

- No library, no NPM package, no installation
- Copy "template" components into your project
  - Based on Radix Primitives<sup>*</sup> (headless components for React)
  - Styled with Tailwind
  - Don't start at 0
- Fully own, customize & (re-)style them
- The UI of the components is commited to your project

<sup>*</sup>well, this *is* a dependency...

# Recap

The many flavors of Radix

- **Radix Themes** \
  = Library of pre-built components \
  (√† la Bootstrap)
- **Radix Primitives** \
  = Library of headless components
- **shadcn/ui** \
  = Collection of "template" components built with Radix Primitives & Tailwind to copy into project
